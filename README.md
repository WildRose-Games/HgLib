# Hgl (Hg Libraries)

A collection of my single-file libraries I use for my minimalist game engine, Mercury. 

Inspired by [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb). Each library file contains it's own documentation. Just copy a file into your project and include it.

|Library   | Version | Description                                            |
|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Hgl_Log.h | v0.1    | Basic logging macros, can be removed on release builds |
